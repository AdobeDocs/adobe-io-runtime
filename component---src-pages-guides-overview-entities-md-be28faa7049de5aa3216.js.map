Almost anything can be classified as an event by defining it as a trigger. In Runtime, events are defined by means of a set of key-value pairs; this allows them to be passed to an action as a JSON object. Triggers are used to define the keys for these pairs. When a trigger is activated (`}<em parentName=\"p\">{`fired`}</em>{`), it reads from the event source the values for these keys and passes on a dictionary of key-value pairs that define the event.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Rules link triggers with actions. Each rule links a specific trigger with a single action: every time the trigger is fired, the rule causes the action to be invoked with the trigger`}{`’`}{`s event used as input parameters. By combining rules, however, you can cause a trigger to fire multiple actions, or cause a action to respond to multiple triggers.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For more information, see this topic:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"../reference/triggersrules.md\"\n        }}>{`Triggers and Rules`}</a></li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"packages\"\n    }}>{`Packages`}</h2>\n    <p>{`In OpenWhisk, you can use packages to bundle together a set of related actions and share them with others.
