# Using Adobe I/O Runtime

Adobe I/O Runtime consists of more than simply deploying individual actions and invoking them directly in the CLI. With Runtime, you can deploy groups of related actions as packages and share them with others; set up actions as webhooks so you can incorporate automatic responses to events in your applications; and access Runtime actions through the API. The following pages guide you through the process:
